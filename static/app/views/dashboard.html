      <h3>Welcome to CG-Deck</h3>
      <p>Pick an organization to get started</p>
      <p>Weâ€™re updating the Deck (soon to be the Dashboard) next week, so hereâ€™s what to expect! ðŸŽ‰ Weâ€™re switching to a new codebase that is more flexible and has better tests, so we can change it much faster than we could with the current Deck. Itâ€™ll match cloud.govâ€™s style and navigation! Initially itâ€™ll be missing some of the Deckâ€™s current options for managing apps, and the user experience will need more work; weâ€™ll improve it based on research and use. You can see <a href="https://console-staging.cloud.gov/">an in-progress preview</a> (and <href="https://github.com/18F/cg-deck/issues">our issue list</a>). Let us know at cloud-gov-support@gsa.gov or <a href="https://18f.slack.com/messages/cloud-gov-liberator/">#cloud-gov-liberator</a> if you have questions.</p>
